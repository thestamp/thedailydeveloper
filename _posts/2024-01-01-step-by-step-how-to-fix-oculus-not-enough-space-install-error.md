excerpt: "Fix the frustrating 'Out of disk space' error when installing Oculus software on Windows, even when you have plenty of space available."

Although a leading provider of VR technologies, Oculus is not known for their Windows software prowess. When you install the Oculus app software and you've encountered an "Out of disk space" error when you have enough disk space, look no further. This is how to get around it.

# The Cause

This error happens when your hard drive is configured as "dynamic disks," that enables certain features for more performance, extendability and reliability. Unfortunately the Oculus setup software didn't account for this.

# The fix in a nutshell

Let's start off by saying that we are **not** reconfiguring your hard drive as "basic" (as most guides out there tell you to do). I don't want to spend hours backing up my data and reinstalling windows just to use VR.

Instead, we are simply creating a disk file (known as a **virtual disk)**, configured as **basic** so that the Oculus software can happily install. This is a feature of Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and above.

# Step by Step

### Part 1 â€“ Create the virtual disk

1. Right click the start button, and click "Disk Management"

2. In the Disk Manager, click "Action" and then "Create VHD"
